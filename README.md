# hw02 -Optional TidyTuesday
This data-set, earn.csv, comes from a 2021 TidyTuesday Challenge. The listing is called "Employment and Earnings". The 'earn.csv' file was sourced from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. This file contains data on median weekly earnings from 2012-2020. 
The visualization I made showcases the change in median weekly earnings for those who are employed, by race, from 2015-2020. I used gg(animate) to create an animated scatterplot of median weekly earnings vs number of people employed in that race. 
Analyzing the visualization, it appears that the number of people employed accross all groups has increased from 2012 to 2020. The largest employed labor force is white people, followed by black then asian people. Additionally it appears that median weekly earnings has increased for all groups.
A limitation of the data that I noticed was that there were not enough ethnic categories, since Latino was completely excluded from the data. 
Attached here is a gif of my visualizationon.![file2552e79272cb9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105371806/174152607-ad1c02a6-b056-4a6f-8bc7-d263646aee5d.gif)
